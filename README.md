# Algorithmic-trading-using-machine-learning
This project demonstrates a machine learning-based algorithmic trading approach using Python. It connects to MetaTrader 5 to fetch market data, preprocesses it, and uses XGBoost to generate predictive trading signals.
## Project Overview
   - Connect to MetaTrader 5 to fetch historical OHLC data.
   
   - Preprocess the data using pandas and numpy.
   
   - Feature engineering for predictive modeling.

   - Train an XGBoost model to generate buy/sell signals.

   - Evaluate performance using validation metrics.

## Requirements

  -  python

  -  jupyter notebook

  -  libraries like install **pandas numpy MetaTrader5 xgboost scikit-learn** etc...


## Features
   - Real-time/historical data fetching from MetaTrader 5.

   - Machine learning with XGBoost for signal generation.

   - Data normalization and scaling with Scikit-learn.

## Outputs

   - Preprocessed market data ready for ML models.

   - Buy/Sell predictions using XGBoost.

   - Performance metrics for strategy evaluation.
